Cookie Playground
=================

This project contains two parts: `tracker` and `website`, and is intended to
show how cookies can be used to track you and send a lot of information to an
third-party service.


## Installation

Install the project by first cloning it (`git clone ...`), then install the
project's dependencies:

    $ composer install

Now, run the application:

    $ php -S localhost:4000 -t .

**Note:** in case you don't want `4000` as port, you will have to update the
port number in `tracker/public/tracker.js` (sorry).

## Usage

The _tracker_ exposes a dashboard at:
`http://localhost:4000/tracker/public/dashboard`.

The _website_ does not do much, but is available at:
`http://localhost:4000/website/`.

### Tracker

The tracker is responsible for serving a single-pixel image along with a cookie,
and, of course, persisting as much client data as possible.

The tracker also offers a simple JavaScript file that is used to build a request
to fetch the single-pixel image from the websites using the service.

### Website

The website requires a JavaScript file from the tracker (Ã  la Google Analytics
or Piwik). That's it.
